# Personal Expenses

**Personal Expenses** is the second application learned from the course [Learn Flutter & Dart to Build iOS & Android Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). Is a basic application designed for Android devices using the Material Widgets. With this application you can create and have a registry of your expenses of the last seven 7 days.

## Responsive

This is the first application of the course that is full responsive with the help of [MediaQuery](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html) and [LayoutBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html).

## Theme your application

During the development of this application, I learn about themes and how to use them to share styles across the entire application. [Themes](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/design/themes)

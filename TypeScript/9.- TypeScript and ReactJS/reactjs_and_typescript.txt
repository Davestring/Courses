For creating a new React app that uses TypeScript, once we have installed globaly 
create-react-app, run:

    >>> sudo create-react-app my-app . --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts

- Where the "dot" says that we will use the current directory and the "--scripts-version" that we 
  are going to use TypeScript.

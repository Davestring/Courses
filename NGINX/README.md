# NGINX

**NGINX** is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. In this respository you will be able to find how to configure **NGINX** setting it up as a service, configuring static file service and connecting to a Python backend, how to optimize NGINX processes, client side and server side caching, reverse proxy, load balancing, secure and encrypted with SSL and more so, letâ€™s get started.

The examples were taken from the course [Nginx Fundamentals: High Performance Servers from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/nginx-fundamentals/).

## Dependencies

![NGINX +10.15.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/NGINX-+1.17.3-green.svg)
![Docker 3.6.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-+19.03.2-blue.svg)

## Configuration

To run any of this examples it's prepared a docker-compose file which takes automatically a *.env* (**environment**) file and search for the *Dockerfile* and *nginx.conf* that are especified, for example if you want to run the example *1-creating-virtual-host* in the *1.-basics* folder then, the *.env* configuration file should look as follows:

> .env file

```bash
DOCKERFILE_PATH=./1.-basics/1.-creating-virtual-host/
NGINX_CONF_PATH=./1.-basics/1.-creating-virtual-host/nginx.conf
```

### Environment File

File that the docker-compose needs to execute correctly. This file needs the following variables:

| Variable        | Value                | Description                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| DOCKERFILE_PATH | ./example            | Relative path were the "x" dockerfile example is located |
| NGINX_CONF_PATH | ./example/nginx.conf | Relative path were the "x" nginx.conf example is located |

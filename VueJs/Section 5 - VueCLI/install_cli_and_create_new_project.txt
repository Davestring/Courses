Vue CLI allows us to fetch vue.js projects templates. To install it run the following command:

    >>> npm install -g vue-cli

When you initialize a new project with the vue-cli, it comes with different templates:

    路 simple: index.html + Vue CDN import.
    路 webpack-simple: Basic webpack workflow.
    路 webpack: Complex webpack workflow that includes tests.
    路 browserify: Browserify workflow

To start a new project run:

    >>> vue init [template] [project name]

To install the project dependencies, go inside the project and execute:

    >>> npm install

Finally, to run the project, go inside the project folder and execute:

    >>> npm run dev

To build the project for production, run:

    >>> npm build
